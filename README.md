# jamal_bot

Jamal Bot is custom Discord bot with the main goal to hold quotes in a database and be able to access them through Discord. This project's main goals was to familiarize myself with SQL commands and python scripting to build an actual working product. This is honestly quite a mess but it works.

## Help

To access the bot's help message send `jamal help` in a channel the bot can read and write.

## Removing quotes

Currently the bot cannot remove quotes from the database because I don't know how I want to implement this thank you for understanding üëç
